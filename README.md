# WNV-Model-Code
Fortran code for a WNV DDE model.

This code defines the DDE model used in the paper "Are West Nile Virus Outbreaks Likely in the UK? A Mechanistic Modelling Approach".  In this version sinusoidal functional forms are supplied for the air and water temperature profiles.  The user may change this to read in field data.

The model code requires a DDE solver which can be found at http://www.radford.edu/~thompson/ffddes/.
